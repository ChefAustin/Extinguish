# Extinguish
Generates configuration profiles to set Sparkle-updater-enabled apps off by default. Inspired by Ben Toms [post on the Sparkle fiasco](https://macmule.com/2016/01/31/sparkle-updater-framework-http-man-in-the-middle-vulnerability/) and [Greg Neagle's profiles](https://github.com/gregneagle/profiles/tree/master/autoupdate_disablers)

#### NOTICE - **You still need to test the effectiveness of the profiles created!** In many cases, this _will not be enough_!
Please see a tool like Tim Sutton's [mcxToProfile](https://github.com/timsutton/mcxToProfile) and follow the workflow that tool provides to collect the appropriate keys for an app that does not work with Extinguish out-of-the-box, or edit the profile generated on your own.
